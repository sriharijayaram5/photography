1. Fork this repo by hitting the `Fork` button at the top right corner.
2. Enable github pages from the repo settings.
3. Upload your pictures to `images/fulls` and `images/thumbs` directory. _You can do that on github.com itself or you can clone and push the images to your repo._
4. Add your own custom domain in `CNAME` file or just remove the file if you don't own a domain and use the default domain that github provides ([yourusername].github.io/photography).
5. Update `baseurl` field in `_config.yml` file with whatever domain you used in step 4.
6. And that's it, your website is set. To view, go to [photography.rampatra.com](http://photography.rampatra.com) (or whatever you have in the CNAME file) and if you don't have one, you can go to [[yourusername].github.io/photography](http://yourusername.github.io/photography)

And, of course, you don't want my name at the bottom to show up. You can change it in `_config.yml` file as well as a few other settings like your social links, google analytics, etc. Just do not forget to [build the website](#build-the-website) after you make the changes.

## Run the website locally to test
1. `$ cd photography` - go to the project directory
2. `$ bundle install` - install gems
3. Change the `baseurl` in `_config.yml`
4. `$ bundle exec jekyll serve` - start/run the website

### Build the website
1. `$ cd photography` - go to the project directory
2. `$ npm install` - install all npm dependencies
3. `$ gulp` - minify css, js, resize images, etc.

Note: You only need to build the website if you make changes such as replacing the images, modifying the css styles, etc.
 
## ProTips

### Resize Images
I have made this as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to __automate image resizing
and thumbnail generation__. So if you're lazy like me then you can just do the following before you push your images to github.

1. Fork and clone the project to your computer
2. Go inside the project `$ cd photography`
3. Install all dependencies by `$ npm install`
4. Copy all your pictures (possibly jpg, the largest size available, straight from your camera) and put it inside `images` directory
5. Run `$ gulp resize` to resize the images and to generate thumbnails automatically
6. Push your changes to github.com by `$ git add --all` and `$ git commit -m "a nice commit message"` and then finally `$ git push origin master`
